# project-lab [Trip List](https://destination-lab.herokuapp.com/)

This is a website that allows you to add a name and image of a destination to a list.

## Description

I wanted to create a way to store information of destinations a person would like to visit. The main focus of the project is to allow you to add a destination of where you want to visit and also a picture of it to a list so you can see them at a glance.

### Feature

* At the top of the page, there are two inputs for you to add text to describe the destination you’re interested in, and also an image URL. Once you’ve populated those fields, you’ll select the “Add place” button to create the new item below the “Destinations” section. 


### Feature

* Below the “Destinations” section, I have already created 3 items as examples. Each item shows the image on top, with an option to delete it completely. As far the delete button goes, I used an Axios Delete request to delete items from the list. As you hit refresh on the page, any item that was deleted will persist aside from the default locations.


### Color Scheme

* I chose a cool palette to put you in vacation mode as soon as you see the colors. Cool colors tend to make you more relaxed and I felt this was a good way to get you in the mood while looking at the destinations. 

### Technologies

* HTML/CSS - I created this project on an HTML site and used CSS to stylize the shapes and colors of the elements.
* JavaScript - I utilized js for functionality of the features listed above. 
* Axios - I used Axios request to create, and delete items from the list.
